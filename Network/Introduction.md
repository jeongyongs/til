## 1. What's the Internet
There are two views that explain the Internet.
### 1.1 nuts and bolts view
This view describes the **components of the Internet**.  
The Internet is a huge network(a.k.a. network of networks).  
- **Network** is collection of devices, packet switches and links.  
- Devices are called **hosts**. Another name is **end system**. e.g., PC, Data Center, Smart Phone.  
- **Packet switches** forward packets(chunks of data). e.g., router, switch.  
- Communication **links** connect each components. e.g., fiber, copper, radio, satellite.
- **Protocols**, the principles of controlling components, are everywhere. e.g., HTTP, TCP, IP Ethernet.
### 1.2 services view
This view focus on services.
- The Internet provides an interface that applications can use to send and receive information to each others.  
Put it simply, We can send and receive messages without having to know the complicated way.
