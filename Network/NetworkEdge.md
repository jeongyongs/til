# Network Edge
There are hosts, clients and servers, at the edge of the network.

## 1. Access Networks
Access network is a network that connects the **host to the edge router** of the core network.
### 1.1. Cable-based access
Cable-based access uses Frequency Division Multiplexing(FDM).  
FDM is a method of dividing channels at different frequencies.
#### 1.1.1. Type
1. **Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC)**
    - Use: Coaxial cable
    - Shared
    - Downstream: 40 Mbps - 1.2 Gbps
    - Upstream: 30 - 100 Mbps
2. **Digital Subscriber line (DSL)**
    - Use: Telephone line
    - Dedicated
    - Downstream: 24 - 52 Mbps
    - Upstream: 3.5 - 16 Mbps
### 1.2. Wireless access
Shared wireless access connets end system to router.
#### 1.2.1. Type
1. **Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)**
    - Use: WiFi
    - Transmission rate: 11, 54, 450 Mbps
2. **Wireless Wide Area cellular Networks (WWANs)**
    - Use: 4G, 5G
    - Transmission rate: 10 - 300 Mbps
### 1.3. Access by user
Above, the Access Network was divided into ways to access the edge router.  
This time, we will look into the network by user.
#### 1.3.1. Type
1. **Home Network**
    - Consist of: Wireless access, Ethernet, Modem
2. **Enterprise Network**
    - Consist of: Wireless access, Ethernet, Router, Switch
3. **Data Center Network**
    - Consist of: High-bandwidth links

## 2. Physical Media
### 2.1. Term
- **bit**: propagates between transmitter/receiver pairs
- **physical link**: what lies between transmitter and receiver
- **guided media**: signals propagate in solid media (e.g., copper, fiber, coax)
- **unguided media**: signals propagate freely (e.g., radio)
### 2.2. Type
1. **Twisted Pair(TP)**: two insulated copper wires
2. **Coaxial cable**: two concentric copper conductors
3. **Fiber optic cable**: glass fiber carrying light pulses, each pulse a bit
4. **Wireless radio**: signal carried in various bands in electromagnetic spectrum  
(e.g., WiFi, Cellular, Bluetooth, Terrestrial Microwave, Satellite)
